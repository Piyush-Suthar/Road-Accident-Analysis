Road Accident Analysis

This project presents an end-to-end Road Accident Analysis using Power BI, including data cleaning, ETL (Power Query), star-schema data modeling, DAX measures, KPIs, and interactive dashboard visuals.
The goal is to identify trends, accident hotspots, severity patterns, and the top contributing factors to support data-driven decision-making.

🚦 Project Overview

Road accidents are a major concern for public safety and traffic management. This project analyzes accident data to uncover:

Traffic accident trends

Most affected states and locations

Accident causes & severity levels

Time-based accident patterns (hour, day, month)

Top 7 causes of accidents

Hotspot identification

📄 Key Insights

Most accidents occur during peak traffic hours.

Certain states show significantly higher accident density.

Human error remains the highest contributing factor.

Accident severity spikes in early mornings and late nights.

A small number of causes contribute to most severe accidents.
