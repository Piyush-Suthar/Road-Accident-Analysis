Project Summary – Road Accident Analysis (Power BI)
The Road Accident Analysis dashboard was developed to analyze accident records across Brazil for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. The project focuses on identifying accident trends, high-risk areas, severity levels, and key causal factors to support data-driven decision-making for logistics and safety planning.
1. Objective
•	Analyze accident patterns by time, location, and severity.
•	Visualize accident hotspots using geolocation (Latitude & Longitude).
•	Provide insights into fatalities, injuries, and victim classification.
•	Identify the Top 7 accident causes.
•	Deliver a one-page interactive dashboard with clear filters.
2. Data Modeling & Preparation
•	Cleaned and standardized dataset (State names, missing values, data types).
•	Extracted important fields: Hour, Day, Month, Year, Season.
•	Added calculated columns for Victim Classification and Incidents with >3 victims.
•	Built a clean data model using one fact table.
3. KPIs Created
•	Total Accidents
•	Total Fatal Victims
•	Total Injured Victims (Minor + Serious)
•	Total Incidents with More Than 3 Victims
•	Classification breakdown:
o	With Fatal Victims
o	With Injured Victims
o	Without Victims
4. Dashboard Visuals
The Power BI dashboard includes:
• Geolocation Map
Accident points plotted using Latitude & Longitude
•	Color-coded by Accident Classification
•	Fully interactive with filters
• Accident Trend Visuals
•	By Hour → identifies peak accident times
•	By Day of Week → weekly pattern
•	By Season → seasonal variations
 Top 7 Causes of Accidents
•	Horizontal bar chart displaying most frequent accident causes
• Victims >3 Visual
•	KPI showing number of incidents with more than 3 victims
5. Filters & Interactivity
Users can filter the dashboard by:
•	Year (2018, 2019, 2020)
•	Month
•	Accident Classification
All visuals update dynamically for interactive exploration.
6. Conclusion
The dashboard provides a comprehensive and intuitive view of accident behavior across Brazil. It highlights high-risk areas, peak accident times, major causes, and severity patterns. These insights help support safer logistics planning and strategic decision-making.
